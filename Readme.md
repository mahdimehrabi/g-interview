# Thanks for considering me in your job applicant interviews. 🤍🙏

# Scalability 
To improve performance we use a queue/worker pattern for sending messages to next service. this pattern has helped me for holding up to 10000 messages in case of disconnecting other services that you requested.<br><br>
To improve scalability we used singleton dependency injection for sources that are limited and I used transient dependency injection for anywhere else. <br>  
To improve scalability/reliability we transfer data in multiple socket connections.  <br><br>
To get the best performance REST API implemented without any framework and implemented using golang http standard library. <br><br>



### Clean Architecture
Architecture of all microservices are clean architecture  


# Extra features
#### implemented unit test for all services
#### benchmark on sender microservice
